Role: You are an expert creative front-end developer and a PHP specialist.

Goal: Create a single-page, responsive portfolio website for a BCA Semester 4 student.

The Vibe ("Antigravity Coder"): The site must feel like the user is floating through deep space. It should not feel like scrolling down a flat page, but rather moving forward through different layers of depth. It needs to be dark, futuristic, glowing, and weightless.

Crucial Technical Constraints:

NO EXTERNAL LIBRARIES. Do not use GSAP, Three.js, jQuery, or Bootstrap.

Must use pure, semantic HTML5.

Must use modern CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid, CSS Variables, Keyframe animations, and crucially, CSS 3D Transforms for depth).

Must use Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) for interactivity and scroll handling.

Must use PHP solely for handling a simple contact form submission.

Core Concept: Vanilla JS Deep Space Parallax Instead of standard 2D parallax where elements just move up at different speeds, I want a 3D optical parallax effect.

Implementation Strategy: The main container should have a CSS perspective set. Different sections (layers) of the site should be placed along the Z-axis using transform: translateZ().

As the user scrolls, JavaScript should update a CSS variable (e.g., --scroll-y) on the root element.

The CSS layers should use calc() based on that variable to move along the Z-axis towards the viewer, creating a genuine feeling of depth and movement through space.

Required Sections & Details:

1. General Styling & Assets

Background: A deep space background (very dark blue/black gradient) with subtle stars.

Colors: Neon cyan, electric purple, and bright green accents against dark backgrounds. Use CSS box-shadow to create glowing neon borders around elements.

Fonts: Use a free Google Font that looks technical and futuristic (e.g., 'Orbitron', 'Rajdhani', or 'Space Mono').

Antigravity idle state: Every major element (project cards, skill icons, headers) must have a slow, subtle, infinite CSS keyframe bobbing animation (moving up and down slightly) so nothing ever looks truly static.

2. Section 1: The Hero Layer (Furthest Back Z-index)

A large headline: "Hi, I'm [Your Name]."

Sub-headline: "BCA Sem 4 | The Antigravity Coder."

A prominent "Enter Space" button that smooth-scrolls down.

3. Section 2: About & Skills Layer (Mid-ground Z-index)

A short "About Me" text block on a semi-transparent, frosted-glass style card (using backdrop-filter: blur).

Skills Area: Instead of progress bars, display skill names (HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, MySQL, Java) inside glowing geometric shapes (hexagons or circles) that float slowly around their container area.

4. Section 3: Projects Layer (Closer Z-index)

Section Title: "Mission Logs (Projects)."

Display 2-3 sample project cards.

The cards should look like futuristic data tablets. When hovered, they should glow brighter and lift slightly closer to the screen (using translateZ and shadow).

5. Section 4: Contact Layer (Closest Z-index)

A simple contact form floating in space.

Fields: Name, Email, Message.

PHP Integration: The form must submit to a PHP script on the same page. The PHP script should sanitize the inputs. For this demo, if successful, just display a glowing "Message Transmitted into the Void" success message above the form without actually sending an email (to keep the code runnable locally without SMTP server config).

Output Required: Please provide the complete code broken down into three clearly separated files:

index.php (Containing the HTML structure and the PHP form handling logic at the top).

style.css (Containing all styling, keyframe animations, and 3D transform setups).

script.js (Containing the vanilla JS scroll event listener to drive the parallax).
